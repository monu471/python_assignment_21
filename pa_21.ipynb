    "\n",
    "True random numbers are generated from a source that is inherently unpredictable, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. They are considered to be truly random because their values cannot be determined or predicted in advance. True random numbers are desirable in certain applications, such as cryptography or simulations, where high levels of unpredictability are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms. These algorithms use a seed value as an input and produce a sequence of numbers that appear to be random. Although the generated numbers are not truly random, they exhibit statistical properties that make them suitable for many practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are considered \"good enough\" in many scenarios because they can simulate randomness effectively for most everyday purposes. PRNGs are designed to have long periods before repeating sequences, and their output passes various statistical tests for randomness. Additionally, they are computationally efficient and can be easily reproduced by using the same seed value.\n",

    "While pseudo-random numbers are not truly random, their statistical properties make them suitable for simulations, modeling, games, and other situations where a high level of unpredictability is sufficient.

    "In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution may not necessarily match the expected probabilities. This is due to the inherent randomness involved in the process. However, as the number of trials increases, the observed outcomes tend to converge towards the expected probabilities, following the principles of probability theory.\n",

In other words, the larger the sample size or number of trials, the closer the empirical distribution will resemble the expected distribution.\n",

    "For example, if you were to repeatedly flip a fair coin, in the short term, you may observe a slightly skewed distribution of heads and tails due to random fluctuations. However, as the number of coin flips increases, the ratio of heads to tails will converge towards the expected 1:1 ratio, approaching the long-term probability distribution.\n",
